This version of the forward modeling includes a constant sky background as a returned parameter.  It is much less well tested than other versions without the sky background.

To build, run

python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This builds the .so library, which you will need to put someplace where Python can find it.

You will likely need to edit the "include_dirs" list in the setup.py file so that the program can find the file:

numpy/arrayobject.h
